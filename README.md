Javascript
Library Project that shows accountability and listings.

This exercise built a website to show how many books were in the libray, how many books were borrowed, how many accounts were registered with the libray.

This project also involved, determining the most popular books that had been checked out and itemized.  

The most common genres were determined and itemized based on how many times the books were checked out.

The last category was the Most Popular Authors with how many times their books were checked out by author.
